  ### rebase ###

  # rebase - forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head.
  rb = rebase

  # rebase abort - cancel the rebasing process
  rba = rebase --abort

  # rebase - continue the rebasing process after resolving a conflict manually and updating the index with the resolution.
  rbc = rebase --continue

  # rebase - restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch.
  rbs = rebase --skip

  # rbi - rebase interactive on our unpushed commits.
  #
  # Before we push our local changes, we may want to do some cleanup,
  # to improve our commit messages or squash related commits together.
  #
  # Let's say I've pushed two commits that are related to a new feature and
  # I have another where I made a spelling mistake in the commit message.
  # When I run "git rbi" I get dropped into my editor with this:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     pick ad544d0 goo
  #     pick de3083a hoo
  #
  # Let's say I want to squash the "foo" and "goo" commits together,
  # and also change "hoo" to say "whatever". To do these, I change "pick"
  # to say "s" for squash; this tells git to squash the two together;
  # I also edit "hoo" to rename it to "whatever". I make the file look like:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     s ad544d0 goo
  #     r de3083a whatever
  #
  # This gives me two new commit messages to edit, which I update.
  # Now when I push the remote repo host receives two commits
  #
  #     3400455 - foo
  #     5dae0a0 - whatever

  # into a commit but daren't stray too far from now without a backup.
